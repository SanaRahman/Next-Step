# NextStep

**Project Name:** NextStep  
**Created using GitHub Copilot in 24 hours**

## About the Project

NextStep is a habit builder and tracker website that helps users build and maintain good habits. Users can:

- **Add a Habit**: Users can input their desired habit.
- **Select Days**: Choose specific days of the week to practice the habit.
- **Track Progress**: The app generates a beautiful tracker graph for each habit. Users can click on the dates to confirm that they've completed the task, helping them maintain streaks and track achievements easily.

This project focuses on making habit tracking fun, easy, and visually appealing, ensuring that users stay motivated and accountable for their goals.

## Experience with GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot was instrumental in building the **NextStep** project, making development seamless and significantly more productive. Here's an overview of the experience:

### Frontend Development

- **Code Assistance**: Writing and modifying the frontend code in Visual Studio became remarkably easy with Copilot. Its suggestions were contextual and accurate, allowing me to implement changes effortlessly.  
- **Inline Chat Feature**: The inline chat feature was a game-changer. It enabled direct communication with Copilot within the IDE, saving time otherwise spent searching for solutions or copy-pasting code.  
- **Workspace Efficiency**: Using the "workspace" tag, I could apply changes across multiple files simultaneously. This feature streamlined the process of maintaining consistency throughout the codebase.  
- **Overall Experience**: Copilot made frontend development fast and efficient, enabling me to focus on designing a user-friendly interface while ensuring high code quality.

### Backend Development

- **Database Integration**: Copilot simplified integrating PostgreSQL with Flask. From setting up database connections to writing SQL queries, its suggestions were accurate and secure, preventing issues like SQL injection with parameterized queries.  
- **Code Optimization**: Repetitive tasks like table creation, CRUD operations, and input validation were streamlined with Copilot’s intelligent suggestions, reducing boilerplate code and boosting efficiency.  
- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Copilot’s real-time feedback for debugging and error handling was invaluable, helping me resolve issues quickly without breaking my workflow.  
- **Inline Chat for Backend**: The inline chat feature allowed me to request specific changes or explanations for backend logic directly in the IDE. This improved efficiency and kept the development process smooth.  
- **Overall Experience**: Copilot transformed backend development into an efficient and enjoyable process. Its ability to provide context-aware recommendations saved time and improved the overall quality of the code.

### Suggested Improvement
- When selecting a portion of code for modification, Copilot should prioritize only the selected part. Occasionally, the inline chat would uncomment unrelated lines, which could be avoided to enhance precision.
